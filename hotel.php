        This is right out of an airline geek’s fantasy. Formerly part of the defunct airline Mandala airlines, this retired Boeing 737 has been transformed into a luxurious private jet villa and is located on a clifftop near Nyang-Nyang, Bali. The cliffside villa is the world’s first luxury hotel to open inside a commercial aeroplane.

      <p>
        Known as the Private Jet Villa, the aircraft was purchased by developer Felix Demin (also the owner of Bubble Hotel Chain) back in 2021 and was transported to its remote location on a cliff 150m above sea level. Transporting the plane and reassembling it in its current location required two cranes and a team of 20 people for two months.

        The villa can be accessed via a staircase leading up along the wing to the main entrance. Inside, there’s a living room with a bar, a sofa bed and a glass portal, as well as two bedrooms with walk-in closets. The cockpit has been converted into a large bathroom with additional portholes. The property also has sun loungers, an outdoor lounge area and a fire pit.
